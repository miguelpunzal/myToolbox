Because of this, the contact is missing from OLM.The same applies to owner contact roles as both owner and member are entity roles for individuals in GROWTH.Action:Update SQL to fetch contacts that are also related to child entities.Note from GROWTH team: In entity role table (ENT_ROLE), Mark Dana’s (Individual ID: 87679) role is not directly associated with entity BAY STREET INVESTORS LLC, with which IHG has a contract signed.

Thanks!  Leslie   "
